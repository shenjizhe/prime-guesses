# largest prime-guesses (shen jizhe guesses)

沈吉喆猜测：没有最大质数，之前所有质数相乘 + 1，必定是质数
Shen Jize guesses: there is no largest prime number. The product of all prime numbers before +1 must be a prime number. 

```
2*3         +1 = 7
2*3*5       +1 = 31
2*3*5*7     +1 = 211
2*3*5*7*9   +1 = 1891
...
```

所以没有必要再去找最大的质数了，因为不存在这个数，数学的基石是无穷的
So there is no need to find the largest prime number, because there is no such number. The cornerstone of mathematics is infinity.
